# F1T
Building a cheap, open-source, autonomous RC-Car

I've been inspired by the F1Tenth tournament for quite a while now. 

Currently using a Jetson Nano DevKit.

I will document my struggles, findings and code in this Repo. 

# IMX219-83 Stereo Camera Module

I've written a python script to have synced frames of both the camera sensors on the Module. 
Information on how to actually do that is quite sparse, therefore, I hope this will be helpful to you!
